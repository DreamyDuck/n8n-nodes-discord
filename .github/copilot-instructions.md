Assume we are leveraging `discord.js` v14.18.0 and `Node.js` v23.10.0, and prefer using built-in functionality from them where possible.
In TypeScript, never use the <any> type, and use <unknown> only when necessary.
Always follow ESLint and Prettier rules.
Avoid adding unnecessary comments to show where code was added.
Prefer the `discord.js` <Collection> over <Map>.
Avoid using depreciated methods from imported packages.
Avoid object injection sinks.
